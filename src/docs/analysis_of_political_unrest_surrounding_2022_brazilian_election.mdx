## The 2022 Presidential Election

In October 2022, following the second round of voting in the closest presidential election in Brazil to date, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that Lula da Silva had won over
then incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro.

In the aftermath, Bolsonaro refused to concede the victory, calling on the Superior Electoral Court to invalidate votes an amount of votes that would have left him with 51% of the count. There was a wave of protests in response,
culminating in January 2023 with Bolsonaro supporters storming the offices of the National Congress, the Presidential Palace, and the Supreme Federal Court, in an attempt to overthrow the
newly sworn in government. Bolsonaro was convicted of attempting to overthrow the government on September 25, 2025 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. 

## An Overview of Political Unrest in Brazil 2022-2024

Using reported incidents taken from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data [(ACLED)](acleddata.com) site, we see that from January of 2022 to January of 2024
they have aggregated reports of 17,148 total incidents of civil disturbance, including protests,
riots, and acts of state violence against civilians. We can see increases that correspond to several key events:
* In August, Bolsonaro stated that
 he and his supporters "must obliterate" the opposition Workers' Party,
leading to Amnesty International stating that there was at least one case of political violence every day, with 88% occurring in September.
* October 2nd, the day of the first round of elections
* The large spike in November, representing the public contesting of the elections
* Finally January when the protestors attempted to unseat the government.

This gives an average of 635 per state, however we can see outliers in several states:

### Tailwind and Daisy
I've gotten used to reaching for [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) once again locking me into [React](https://react.dev/). Sticking with the concept of
framework agnosticism I'm using [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/) for coherent styling and the DAISY component library.

### The Blog
[Astro](https://astro.build) comes with a [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) API that essentially
gives it a built-in headless CMS. It supports writing posts in Markdown or MDX. I've wired it up with a GitHub action so it gets published
whenever I push the repository, making it really easy to update. Source for this site, including the GitHub workflow can be found
[here](https://github.com/SMcLeaish/astro-blog).

[Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/) has a nice plugin for styling text called [typography](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) that works great with
Markdown. It really simplifies styling free-text.

I've been using [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) as my text editor for the last couple of months, and I'll probably do a post on it in the future, because it rocks.
While not limited to [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/), while building this site I found [ltex-ls-plus](https://github.com/ltex-plus/ltex-ls-plus), a language server that
adds grammar and spell-checking to your Markdown editor. Integrating it into [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) was very easy using the reference [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) maintains on their
[Language Server Configurations](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Language-Server-Configurations) page.

### Why Blogging?
It feels weird blogging in 2025. I'm not great about taking notes, and I have a bad tendency to jump between projects.
I'm hoping that trying to publish something occasionally as I'm going along will help with both of those problems. If anyone happens along
and is working on the same things as me all the better.

### What I'd still like to get working
* One gripe about the [Astro](https://astro.build) [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
is it doesn't have a built-in way to do post excerpts, so right now my main page displays the description from the front matter. I've seen
some ways to work around this, but I'm going to get to that later.

* I'd like to have a table of contents for my posts. I wanted to get this site up and running, perfect is the enemy of good, so I'll get to
that later as well.

* A search bar is definitely something that I'll want to implement at some point.

* Pagination. Similar to the search bar, it'll make sense when I've got more posts.

So, on the to-do list:

- [ ] Excerpts
- [x] Table of Contents
- [ ] Searching
- [ ] Pagination

I'll update this page as I get them working.
