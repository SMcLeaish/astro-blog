### Week 2 - Object-Oriented Programming 
We're still getting our feet wet with python. This week we dove into object-oriented for the folks that hadn't seen it before. Part of my goal in this course was to have some
reusable classes that make life easier for people doing this type of data shaping and visualization at work. When I worked on a team with data scientists in the past, I
saw a lot of redundancy. I think my value add to the team as a software developer who didn't really know much about data science was creating classes that did a lot of the shaping
and cleaning steps that I saw getting repeated a lot.
