title: Building a Static Website Using Astro Content Collections

description: "I decided to create a personal website to highlight some of my projects. After experimenting with a number of different solutions I ended up choosing Astro to build the static site and Tailwind and DaisyUI to style it."

## Background - Why Astro?
I've used and enjoyed [Astro](https://astro.build) for a few projects, for a number of reasons:
* [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) let you use components from different frameworks and decide if and when
they're loaded. It offers performance increases, but it also gives you a lot of options for experimentation with mixing frameworks. I did a few small elements
of [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) when building the site (though none are currently visible), and want to play around with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) a bit,
and the Astro co-creator Fred Schott has spoken about htmx integrating well with the Astro philosophy.

* On the projects where I've used Astro in the past I've tried to use frameworks sparingly and lean into html/css or vanilla JS. I'm used to
[React](https://react.dev) and had been drawn to Astro to reconnect to the basics.
* [Astro](https://astro.build) uses file based routing. Coming from React and wrapping things in the router, I dug this NextJS style simplicity. 
* [Astro](https://astro.build) recommends using [Nano Stores](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/) for state, which seems like a
good compromise to bring state into a framework-agnostic site.



### Astro for Blogging
[Astro](https://astro.build) comes with a [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) API that lets you pull
parts from documents written in Markdown or MDX. It uses [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) to process the markdown
and render as html, while also giving access to the document frontmatter, as well as collecting the headers, which will be how I'll build a table of contents in the future.
I've wired it up with a GitHub action so it gets published whenever I push the repository, making it function in a sort of CMS fashion, without having to manage a CMS.
Source for this site, including the GitHub workflow can be found
[here](https://github.com/SMcLeaish/astro-blog).

## Tailwind and Daisy
I've gotten used to reaching for [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for styled components once again locking me into [React](https://react.dev/). I don't want to
have to build my own styled component structure though, and I like the simple utility of [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/), so I'm using [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

### Tailwind Typography
[Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/) has a nice plugin for styling text called [typography](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) that works great with
Astro's markdown rendering. It really simplifies styling free-text.

## Editing Markdown
I've been using [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) as my text editor for the last couple of months, and I'll probably do a post on it in the future, because it rocks.
While not limited to [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/), while building this site I found [ltex-ls-plus](https://github.com/ltex-plus/ltex-ls-plus), a language server that
adds grammar and spell-checking to your Markdown editor. Integrating it into [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) was very easy using the reference [Helix](http://helix-editor.com/) maintains on their
[Language Server Configurations](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Language-Server-Configurations) page.

## What I'd still like to get working
* One gripe about the [Astro](https://astro.build) [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
is it doesn't have a built-in way to do post excerpts a la Hugo, so right now my main page displays the description from the front matter. I've seen
some ways to work around this, but I'm going to get to that later.

* ~I'd like to have a table of contents for my posts. I wanted to get this site up and running, perfect is the enemy of good, so I'll get to
that later as well~. *I intend to write up how I made the table of contents sometime soon*

* A search bar is definitely something that I'll want to implement at some point.

* Pagination. Similar to the search bar, it'll make sense when I've got more posts.

So, on the to-do list:

- [ ] Excerpts
- [x] Table of Contents 🎉
- [ ] Searching
- [ ] Pagination

I'll update this page as I get them working.
