# Python higher order functions
## Starting off the course
This week I started a data analytics bootcamp. The official title is Data and Development Immersive.
There was a pretty substantial amount of pre-course work, focusing on python and statistics. 
The course is designed for people without any experience, so I had a leg up on the python. The assignments were all online, and graded with pytest assertions,
so as long as the tests returned correctly you passed. During the first week of the course we similarly spent a lot of time doing python fundamentals that were
automatically graded. I took this as an opportunity to play around a bit, getting more comfortable with python's higher order functions, list comprehension and
dictionary comprehension.

```py

*A couple of fun examples*
We are doing daily warmup exercises, I started a repository which can be found here ----repo---- to try and organize them, I think some of my solutions might be fun to dive into.
Since this isn't my first programming experience I'm trying to use the warmups as a place to get creative, not necessarily using the most straight forward or efficient solution,
but stretching out to learn a little bit more about python.
