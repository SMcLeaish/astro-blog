### Background - Why Astro?
I wanted to give a little background on this site. I've used and enjoyed [Astro](https://astro.build) for a few projects,
for a number of reasons:

* Mix and match frameworks
* SSR/CSA both supported
* File-based routing
* [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) - for selective hydration

### Why Blogging?
I've never been a big blogger, but I was reading about [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
and before long I had ended up making this page. I'm hoping that making an effort to write a bit about what I'm doing as I go will give things
a chance to gel a bit.

Maybe I can come back in the future to reflect on exactly why I made some decision I made in the past.

Maybe even someone reads this and figures out something that gets them unstuck.

### Tailwind and Daisy
On previous projects with [Astro](https://astro.build), I've still ended up going back to what I know and pulling in [React](https://react.dev) and often [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)
for styling, essentially making a [React](https://react.dev) app with extra steps. I wanted to try doing something a little more lightweight, and
I ended up building this page with just [Astro](https://astro.build),
