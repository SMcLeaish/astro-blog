        I'm a father to two absolutely insane boys and tolerated by an amazing woman to whom I've been married for 14 years.
        I have a 130 pound German Shephard/Great Pyrenees rescue that my wife refers to as my husband, as well as a coterie of other less important but well taken care of domestic animals.

          I'm a lifelong computer hobbyist. Currently I'm in a data analytics bootcamp, following a prior software development program run by the same team. 
            Though programming isn’t in my job title, I work in an information-dense environment and often bridge technical and operational work.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
          These training periods let me step back from daily duties to deepen my understanding of the technical systems that support our organization. 
          I’ve collaborated with data science, DevOps, and full-stack teams using Python, Go, and TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Outside of work, I’m interested in cybersecurity, home-labbing, amateur radio, and embedded electronics. Lately, I’ve been building more projects in Rust. Having grown up in Texas, I am competent at barbecue.
